# CodeIn69Days 🚀

A **69-day structured coding training journey** focused on building strong algorithmic thinking, mastering coding interview patterns, and maintaining consistent daily practice.

This repository serves as:
- A **daily learning log**
- A **code archive**
- A **self-discipline system** for long-term growth

---

## 🎯 Goal

- Build solid foundations in **data structures & algorithms**
- Master **coding interview patterns**
- Develop a habit of **daily focused coding**
- Track progress clearly and honestly over 69 days

---

## 📅 Training Structure

Each day follows a simple but strict rule:

> **Every day includes learning + coding + reflection**

### Daily Components
- 📘 **Algorithm / Pattern Study**
  - labuladong (algorithm frameworks & core ideas)
  - *Coding Interview Patterns* (pattern-based problem solving)
- 💻 **Hands-on Coding**
  - LeetCode-style problems
  - Pattern implementation
- 📝 **Daily Summary**
  - What I learned
  - What confused me
  - What to improve tomorrow
